# The model identify hidden patterns , structures or relation in the data
# Used for EDA exploratory data analysis
# Can handle large volumes of data

# TEchnique of unsupervised learning

# Clustering
# Algorithms for clustering
# K-means clustering
# Hierarchical clustering
# Density based spartial clustering

# Advantages of unsupervised learning
# used for discovering unknown patterns
# No need for labelled data
# Can handle large volumes and comlpex of data
# Flexible for EDA


# Example One : Real world problems
